"""
Delta-sync Phase 5: bootstrap a new/reinstalled spoke from a peer's current state.

A new peer has no event history for the corpus that predates its join. generate_baseline()
reads the SOURCE's current memories (and tombstones) ON DEMAND and emits a deterministic,
idempotent set of baseline events plus a durable watermark (the event-log position at the
snapshot). install_baseline() applies those events on the TARGET via the existing Phase 4
apply path and parks the per-peer cursor at the watermark, so live pull/push continues from
there with no reprocessing.

Reuses, never reinvents (G1): events are applied through apply_remote_event (idempotent by
immutable (agent_id, event_id)); the cursor is set via advance_sync_cursor.

RFC §9.3 (bootstrap). SPEC: spec-delta-sync-fase5.md.
