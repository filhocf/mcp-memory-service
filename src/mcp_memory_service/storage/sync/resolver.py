"""Delta-sync resolver: deterministic conflict resolution for concurrent events.

This module provides pure functions (no I/O, no network) for resolving conflicts
between concurrent events for the same content_hash. Implements ADR-0012/0013.

The resolver uses a strict ordering hierarchy:
1. HLC (Hybrid Logical Clock) ordering - later wins
2. Delete-vs-update semantics - delete wins on equal HLC
3. Agent ID then event ID - deterministic final tie-break (UUID → total order)

Quality/importance is intentionally NOT part of the hierarchy: it is a local,
mutable retrieval-ranking signal and must never influence conflict resolution,
or hosts would diverge (ADR-0013).

All functions are deterministic and commutative: resolve(a,b) == resolve(b,a),
and associative, so reduce_events converges regardless of fold order.
