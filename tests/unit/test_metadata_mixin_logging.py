"""What ``MetadataMixin`` logs from outside stays in one record.

``test_log_injection_guard.py`` checks the source of storage/mixins/metadata.py.
This calls two of its methods on a mixin with a stubbed executor and reads
what the logger emitted. ``get_conflicts`` logs the exception text of a
failed query; ``_record_conflicts`` logs the first characters of the hash it
was handed; ``update_memory_metadata`` logs the exception text of a failed
read as the whole message, one line above the gate's pattern. A newline
inside any of them must come out as a literal ``\\n``, not as a second line
that reads like a forged entry. All three tests fail against ``main``.
Part of #1146.
