Keeps the log-injection backlog from growing back.

Check 6.5 of ``scripts/pr/pre_pr_check.sh`` flags f-string logger calls that do
not wrap their values in ``_sanitize_log_value()``. It scans whole files rather
than diffs, so a file carrying old unsanitised calls blocks every PR that
touches it -- three files had 163 between them and were effectively unpatchable.
See issue #1119.

The modules listed in ``GUARDED_MODULES`` have been cleaned: values that come
from outside are sanitised, and internal scalars use ``%``-style lazy formatting,
which carries no interpolation for an attacker to reach. Two scans run over each
of them:

- the line scan the shell gate performs, so a regression here is exactly what
  would fail somebody else's PR;
- an AST scan, which also sees the multi-line calls the line-based gate misses.

Add a module to the list once it is clean. Do not remove one to make this pass.
